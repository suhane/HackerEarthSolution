1. Define Sub problems and count how many there are?
They can be in three categories:

    1. prefix
    2. Suffix
    3. substrings

2. To solve a sub problem Guess( a part of solution) and count the possibilities of that solution(Better be polynomial)
3. Recurrence: Using that guess you write a recurrence relating the solution to the sub problem you want to solve in terms of smaller sub problem
something you already know how to solve. When you do that you get some running time in order to compute that recurrence ignoring the recursion thats
time for sub problem
4. Recurse +memoize/ bottom up

Figure out the topological order:

for prefixes  its left to right with i increasing
for suffixes its right to left with i decreasing
for substring its increasing substring size

5 Solve the original problem
